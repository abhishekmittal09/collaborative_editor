haan i was looking into it.. i things there no direct way of doing this.. there are two possibilities actually..
1. to upload the user content on the server and then retrieve the information as and when needed
2. to take the permissions from the bookmarks app provided by google and exploit it's features (this may not solve our purpose completely)..

Hi congrats yr.... really very nice to here this.. :).... no unfortunately i have never been to noida.. and don't worry we can always continue whenever u want.. :)

Just remember to enjoy a lot and work hard and learn a lot..... :)
-----------------------

aah thanx buddy,....but i am afraid...if it is an electronics company, then i, being a cse student can't go there..bcoz in future no cse company will hire us and sara profile khraab ho jayega.....
plz guide me wat to do bcoz the profile of this cmpany is really good but it is an electronics company....

Yr unfortunately I am not the right person for suggestions, but still in my view since the company is good, u should definitely go for intern, and it would be a great experience and learning.. :)
But make sure that they also give a PPO, in that case it would be really awesome....

ok listen......m confused..i'll b back in clg on 23rd june.....we can resume to that plugin project then and i will consult my authorities regarding this company...ok.....contact me on 23rd june  :)

I would suggest u to ask ur seniors rather than authorities.. they will guide u better. Also if u have someone in the company do ask them about the company and the type of work they give u .. :)

i don't think we hav any senior in this company but i will chk it out...good suggestion thanx
....and always i say, u r a good frnd....be in touch always
chal gtgo......my bhl..ai had an accident.
i'll b back in clg on  23rd ...this monday....see ya then
take care

(Y).. :D
Then just don't worry.. :)..
